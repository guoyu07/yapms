## Contributing to YAPMS

First of all I would like to thank you for your contributions! If you are considering contributing but have questions then please do not hesitate to [reach out to me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/rjforbe).

### How to report a issue or contribute a feature

1. If you don't have a GitHub account, you will need to register for one. It's easy at [GitHub](https://github.com).

2. Please perform a search first to see if the issue, or issue covering a feature already exists. If the issue exists, you can add clarification or more information to the issue. If the issue covers a feature, you can reach out to the individual who created the issue to check on its progress.

3. If you don't find any similar issues or issues that cover features you want to contribute, you can create a "new issue".

4. It may be necessary to provide additional information upon request or you might be asked if the issue still occurs after an update.

5. In the event you notice that the issue doesn't occur anymore, you can close it yourself, please add a note stating the issue has been resolved.

If you find the issue you created already exists then please close the issue and reference the original issue in the notes.

1. Create the issue, make note of the issue number, and include a title and comment that best describes the feature you want to implement.
1. Wait for feedback from myself (JayForbes), before beginning.
1. If proceeding with the new feature, be sure to call your branch FEATURE-[number_of_the_issue].
1. Save and commit often. The more detailed the commit messages the better.
